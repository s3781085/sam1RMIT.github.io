									<h2>Interest in IT</h2>
									<p>I am interested in it as I find it amazing how technology is able to improve our lives so much and it is integrated in almost every part of out lives. I’m interested to find out how it achieves this with even the simplest functions that people take for granted e.g. video calls, listening to music, etc.
									I first started getting interested in IT in year 8 when I did a programming subject in school. I found it fascinating how the language in programming works and how it was able to produce different outputs through it. my it experience is the programming subject in year 8, computer studies in year 11 VCE and software development in year 12 VCE.  </p>
									<p>I chose to come to RMIT as this institution has a very good reputation within Australia and multiple friends recommended it. another factor in my decision for going to rmit is that I went to the open day of several universities around Victoria and found that I preferred the environment of RMIT compared to the other universities.
									I also believe that the method they use to teach the degree I want suits my learning style, which influenced my decision. </p>
