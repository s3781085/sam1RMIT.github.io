									<h2>Interest in IT</h2>
									<p>I am interested in IT as I find it amazing how technology is able to immensely improve our lives and how it is integrated in almost every part of society. It 
									is also amazing that even the simplest functions are taken by granted by society and just seen as the norm instead of an amazing advancement to our world, people a hundred or more 
									years ago would 
									perceive as magic, for example video calls, listening to music, etc. I first started getting interested in IT in year 8 when I did a programming subject in school. 
									I found it fascinating how the language in programming works and that it is able to produce different outputs through it. My experience in IT is the programming 
									subject in year 8, computer studies in year 11 VCE and software development in year 12 VCE, where I learnt HTML and PHP.</p>
									<p>I chose to come to RMIT as this institution has a very good reputation within Australia and multiple friends recommended it. Another factor in my decision for 
									going to RMIT is that I went to the open day of several universities around Victoria and found that I preferred the environment 
									of RMIT compared to the other universities. I also believe that the method they use to teach the degree I want suits my learning style, which influenced my decision greatly. </p>
									<p>I expect to learn in RMIT everything I will need to excel in the outside world e.g. in the jobs that I will ultimately begin. As well as any experience and 
									skills I will need, for example teamwork, communication skills, leadership etc. </p>

									<h2>Project Idea</h2>
									<p> This project will be an app which will help people that take prescription medication understand their medications better, it will inform them of the use, side effects ad any other important 
									details about their medications. The app will also advise what over the counter medications users can or cannot take with 
									their prescribed medication, this will ensure that the over the counter medication wont have an adverse effect on the perscribed medication.
									This app will also have having a set reminder to notify people to take their medication, if the user has to take the medication at a specific time this feture will
									ensure that they dont miss it.

									<h2>Motivation</h2>
									<p>This project will be useful as in Australia approximately 9 million people are taking proscribed medication daily according to a recent survey of more than 1000 adult Australians. When this many 
									people having to take prescription medication there is a need for people to understand the medications their putting into their bodies and why, but with the internet they often have to go to 
									several different websites to find the information they want. This app will solve this problem by having all the information in one place, making it easier for users to access the information need.

									<h2>Features</h2>
									<p>This application will show users information about the medication they search in the system. The information about the medication includes but is not limited to what it’s for, 
									side effects, what its used for, precautions etc. This allows users to access the data they need in one place without having to scour the internet, which is more efficient for the user. 
									</p>
									<p>The application will also have a feature that enables the user to find out what can affect the over the counter medication can have on the prescription medication. For example, if the user 
									has a cold, they may want to find out which over the counter cold medications they can take that doesn’t have a negative effect on the prescription medication they currently take. The features on 
									the application will allow the user to either have their medications pre-saved in the app or enter their medications manually into the app, this will allow the user to be able to find out what can affect the prescription 
									medications they take. This feature will include a listing option as well as a search box so the user can either enter what they want to compare the prescribed medication with or to list the best over 
									the counter medications to take based on what they want to achieve, for example they can select congestion medication to see the list of best to worst congestion medications based on their
									prescribed medication. 
									</p>
									<p>The app will work in a way that show’s in the example of flu medication the feature will show the best to worst things the user can take for flu medications based on the prescription medication 
									they take or if they enter in the search engine the brand and type of flu medication they want to uses, the app will tell them if its alright to take that specific over the counter medication or not. 
									</p>
									<p>Though this feature may have some drawbacks as it will be difficult making a database with the information needed to achieve this feature due to the shear amount of prescribed and over the counter medication sold today.
									</p>
									<p>In the feature that shows users the best to worst medications to take based on users prescribed medication, there will be another feature that shows the user the rating of best to use to worst to use medications through 
									pictures and colours, for example green happy face is fine to take and red angry face shows not to take with users prescribed medication.
									</p>
									<p>The application will also have a notification system to notify users to take their medication at specific times. If the users have medication they need to take at a specific time, they can input it into the app specifying 
									the time of the day they need to take it and what days e.g. every day, every second day etc.

									<h2>Tools and Technologies</h2>
									<p>The tools and technologies I will need to build the app is first a laptop to configure the app on, a server with source control system to ensure that the changes made on the apps code are stored in a space able to be 
									retrieved at any time. There is also a need for high speed internet connection, as well as different models of mobiles to make sure that the app works on the different platforms. I will require some kind of app building 
									program, for example BiznessApps, which is software that can make mobile apps.

									<h2>Skills Required</h2>
									<p>To make the app I will need to know some kind of programming language, for example python, php buildfire.js, etc. There will also be a need to know UX design as the app will need to be visually appealing and more 
									importantly easy for the user to understand for the user. I will also need some understanding in databases as I will need to input medications as well as their details into the app. It will be slightly difficult to 
									find the skills ill need for this project as I’ll have to find several different people who are proficient in these separate areas of skill.

									<h2>Outcome</h2>
									<p>If this project is successful it will be able to inform people about their medication as well as to inform them about over the counter medications reaction to their prescribed medication. It will also be able to 
									notify users if they choose, when they need to take their medications. This application will be beneficial for the millions of people who regularly take prescription medication, as they will be more informed about 
									their medications as well as decrease the likelihood of users forgetting to take their prescribed medications. This result will improve peoples lives by making it easier for them to access the relevant information 
									they need efficiently without having to look through several web pages or go to their GP which can take time and money.
